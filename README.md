# Data Analysis Series: Basic Pandas

Welcome to the **Data Analysis** series! In this section, we will introduce **Pandas**, one of the most widely-used libraries for data manipulation and analysis in Python. This series is split into two parts: **Basic Pandas** and **Pandas DataFrames**, designed to help you gain a strong foundation in working with structured data.

---

## Part 1: **Basic Pandas**

### ✅ **Pandas Series**
A **Pandas Series** is one of the core data structures in Pandas. In this section, we explore how to create Series, their properties, and how they are similar to and different from lists or arrays in Python. Mastering Series is essential for working with data in Pandas.

### ✅ **Indexing**
**Indexing** is the key to accessing elements in a Series. This section covers label-based and position-based indexing techniques, allowing you to select data using custom indexes efficiently.

### ✅ **Conditional Selection (Boolean Arrays)**
Learn how to filter and select data based on conditions using **Boolean arrays**. This powerful technique allows you to subset data dynamically based on specific criteria, making it easier to analyze large datasets.

### ✅ **Operations and Methods**
Pandas Series provide a wide variety of **operations and methods** for mathematical computations, data transformations, and statistical analysis. In this section, we introduce the most commonly used methods for data manipulation and computation.

### ✅ **Boolean Arrays**
Dive deeper into **Boolean arrays** for filtering and condition-based operations. Boolean indexing is a vital tool for efficiently selecting data that meets specific conditions in your datasets.

### ✅ **Modifying Series**
Learn how to **modify Series** by adding new elements, updating values, and handling missing data. Modifying Series is a key step in cleaning and transforming data, making it ready for further analysis.

## Part 2: **Pandas DataFrames**

### ✅ **Intro to Pandas - DataFrames**
A **Pandas DataFrame** is a two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structure. This section introduces DataFrames, explaining how they work and why they are perfect for handling structured data (like spreadsheets and SQL tables).

### ✅ **Indexing, Selection, and Slicing**
Master **indexing**, **selection**, and **slicing** techniques in DataFrames. Learn how to efficiently access rows and columns, subset data, and manipulate it according to your needs.

### ✅ **Conditional Selection (Boolean Arrays)**
Just like with Series, **Boolean arrays** allow you to filter DataFrames based on conditions. This section covers how to perform conditional selection to isolate specific rows and columns.

### ✅ **Dropping Stuff**
In this section, we cover how to **drop** unwanted rows, columns, or specific elements from a DataFrame. Dropping is crucial for cleaning data and removing irrelevant information.

### ✅ **Operations**
Learn how to perform a variety of **operations** on DataFrames, from basic arithmetic to more complex transformations. These operations are essential for modifying and analyzing data efficiently.

### ✅ **Modifying DataFrames**
We’ll explore how to **modify DataFrames** by adding, updating, or removing columns, as well as handling missing data. This section teaches you how to adapt DataFrames to suit your analysis needs.

### ✅ **Creating Columns from Other Columns**
Learn how to **create new columns** based on existing ones. This section explains how to derive new information from existing columns, making your data more insightful.

### ✅ **Statistical Information**
Finally, we dive into **statistical analysis** in Pandas, covering how to calculate descriptive statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and more. This is essential for quickly summarizing and understanding your data.

These notes will provide you with the core skills you need to manipulate and analyze data using **Pandas**. Whether you're just getting started or want to strengthen your data analysis toolkit, this series will help you unlock the full potential of Pandas for effective data manipulation.
